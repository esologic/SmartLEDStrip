# Project Description

StripPi is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the IR remote controller that comes bundled with most analog RGB LED strips. It enables users to control their LEDs via the browser, or through analog controls on device. It is based around the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) single board computer. You can read more about this project [here]( http://www.esologic.com/?page_id=1569).

## Credits

This project is built on a couple other open-source projects:

* The webpage served to the user for web control is based on [FlexiColorPicker](https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker)
* Users can configure the LEDs to be driven via DMA-based PWM, which uses [pi-blaster](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster)

Both of these projects are licenced under the MIT Licence.
